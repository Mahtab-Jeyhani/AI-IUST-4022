### Decision Tree

+ The aim of this project is to utilize decision trees for classifying bank customers based on their features and predicting whether they will create long-term deposits or not. This project identifies profitable customers and aims to attract them through marketing campaigns.

+ In this project, we refrain from using pre-built libraries and instead utilize entropy and Information Gain methods for constructing decision trees. The model is evaluated using cross-validation and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. All parts of the project are developed manually without relying on instructional texts or guides.
