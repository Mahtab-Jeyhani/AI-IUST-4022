## Neural Networks

MLP Project:

+ I employed an MLP to learn functions within a specific domain, subsequently subjecting the network to noise to assess its performance under varied conditions.

Function Detection Project:

+ I utilized the drawdata.xyz website to create a function and exported it as a CSV file. Subsequently, I employed a custom neural network to estimate this function.
